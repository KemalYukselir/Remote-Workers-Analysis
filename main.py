      # üåç **Remote Worker Analysis** üåç
      ## By **Kemal Yukselir**

      ### **Description:**
      This project explores workplace survey data to understand what influences whether individuals seek support for burnout. 
      It uses data analysis, decision tree modelling, and comment analysis to highlight how personal and workplace conditions relate to burnout support.

      ### **References:**
      - [OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)

      ### **Modules Used:**
      - **Pandas**  
      - **NumPy**  
      - **Scikit-learn**  
      - **Xgboost**  
      - **GridSearchCV**  
      - **Streamlit**  
      - **Matplotlib**  
      - **Seaborn**  
      - **Nltk**

      ### **Project Highlights:**
      With all ethical practices considered, this is the best model achieved after multiple iterations:

      - üß™ **Training Accuracy:** 0.8514
      - üßæ **Testing Accuracy:**  0.8649

      #### **üìä Classification Report:**

    ## Responsible Use of Machine Learning in Burnout Support Analysis

    **Overview**  
    - This project uses self-reported survey data to explore which factors influence whether individuals seek support for burnout.  
    - While models like this can raise awareness and guide supportive policies, they must be used responsibly.

    ### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Ethical Considerations

    - **Bias in Data**  
      - The dataset reflects personal and workplace experiences that may vary across regions and cultures.  
      - Categorical variables such as gender and age are handled carefully to avoid reinforcing stereotypes.  
      - The model is not intended for individual prediction or decision-making.

    - **Data Privacy**  
      - The data used is anonymised and publicly available. No personally identifiable information is included.  
      - The open-ended comment data is analysed for general themes only, not linked to individuals.

    - **Accountability**
      - If you have any concerns or suggestions regarding the ethical implications of this project:
        - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kemal-yukselir/)
        - [Email Me](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&to=K.Yukselir123@gmail.com&tf=cm)

    - **Transparency & Interpretability**  
      - The model used (Decision Tree) was chosen for its transparency and ease of interpretation.  
      - Head over to the Project Overview for details on how features were selected and evaluated.
      - This is an open source project available on [GitHub](https://github.com/KemalYukselir/Remote-Workers-Analysis)


    - **Intended Use**  
      - This project is for **educational and analytical purposes only**.  
      - It is meant to explore trends in burnout support-seeking behaviour ‚Äî not to diagnose or classify individuals.  
      - It should not be used for employment decisions, profiling, or mental health evaluation.

    ### **Key Insights:**
    **Figure 1:**
    - First I wanted to check how big the burnout problem is.
    - An alarming 52.703% of Remote workers reported feeling burnout.
                
    **Figure 2:**
    - Before we dive in further, I want to highlight to employers this problem affects them and the company as a whole. Not just the employee.
    - We can see out of those who burnout, most of them feel that it "often" and "sometimes" affects the work they do.
    - Employers addressing this issue will not only help the employee but also the company as a whole.
                    
    **Figure 3:**
    - Then I wanted to check if the type of company was the main reason for the burnout.
    - From the graphs, we can see that tech and non tech companies have nearly equal distribution of burnout. So we can rule out that the type of company is not the main reason for the burnout.
    - So it must be a company structural issue in the workplace.
    
    **Figure 4:**
    - Figure 4 shows that on average, the less employees a comapny has, the more liekly they are to burnout.
    - Could this indicate that smaller companies have more pressure on their employees?
    - Or could it be that larger companies have more resources to help their employees?

    **Figure 5:**
    - Figure 5 shows that most employees who are burnt out, their company does not offer mental health as part of their employee wellness program.
    - This shows that comapnies need to invest more in their employee wellness programs to avoid burnout.
    - This could be weekly check ins, gym membership incentives, or even just a simple coffee break with the team.
    
    **Figure 6:**
    - Figure 6 shows that most emplyees who are burnt out, their company does not provuide resources to seek and get help when avoiding burnout.
    - Just a simple check in with the emplyees can help guide them to the right resources.
                   
    ## **Conclusion:**
    There is significant burnout when it comes to remote working. Both employees, employers and the company as a whole need to be aware of this since it affects all parties.
    It has been concluded that the type of company is not the main reason for the burnout. It must be a structural issue in the workplace.
    Some key insights show that companies need to invest more in their complyee wellness programs and provide resources to seek help for remote workers.
    This could be weekly check ins, gym membership incentives, or even just a simple coffee break with the team.
                
    While remote working could benefit the employee and reduce the costs of the company, if it's not approached right, 
    it can go wrong for the employee and the company as a whole.
