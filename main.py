      ## By **Kemal Yukselir**

      ### **Description:**
      This project explores workplace survey data to understand what influences whether individuals seek support for burnout. 
      It uses data analysis, decision tree modelling, and comment analysis to highlight how personal and workplace conditions relate to burnout support.

      ### **References:**

      ### **Modules Used:**
      - **Pandas**  
      - **NumPy**  
      - **Scikit-learn**  
      - **Xgboost**

    ## Responsible Use of Machine Learning in Burnout Support Analysis

    **Overview**  
    - This project uses self-reported survey data to explore which factors influence whether individuals seek support for burnout.  
    - While models like this can raise awareness and guide supportive policies, they must be used responsibly.

    ### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Ethical Considerations

    - **Bias in Data**  
      - The dataset reflects personal and workplace experiences that may vary across regions and cultures.  
      - Categorical variables such as gender and age are handled carefully to avoid reinforcing stereotypes.  
      - The model is not intended for individual prediction or decision-making.

    - **Data Privacy**  
      - The data used is anonymised and publicly available. No personally identifiable information is included.  
      - The open-ended comment data is analysed for general themes only, not linked to individuals.

    - **Accountability**
      - If you have any concerns or suggestions regarding the ethical implications of this project:
        - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kemal-yukselir/)
        - [Email Me](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&to=K.Yukselir123@gmail.com&tf=cm)

    - **Transparency & Interpretability**  
      - The model used (Decision Tree) was chosen for its transparency and ease of interpretation.  
      - Head over to the Project Overview for details on how features were selected and evaluated.
      - This is an open source project available on [GitHub](https://github.com/KemalYukselir/Remote-Workers-Analysis)


    - **Intended Use**  
      - This project is for **educational and analytical purposes only**.  
      - It is meant to explore trends in burnout support-seeking behaviour ‚Äî not to diagnose or classify individuals.  
      - It should not be used for employment decisions, profiling, or mental health evaluation.
