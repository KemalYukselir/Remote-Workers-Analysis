        > _"Going through Digital Futures training for 3 months has been a great learning experience.  
        However, based on both my own experience and the experience of my peers, remote work has also been a significant challenge.  
        This inspired me to explore the topic of burnout among remote workers."_

        ### **Description:**
        This project explores workplace survey data to understand what influences whether remote workers experience burnout.  
        It uses data analysis, XGBoost modelling, and comment analysis to highlight how personal and workplace conditions relate to burnout risk and support.

        ### **About The Dataset:**    
        - The survey was conducted by OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness).
        - A record in this survey represents a worker in tech and non tech companies.
        - The dataset contains generic questions about themself and their workplace.
        - I have narrowed down the dataset to only inlcude remote workers for this project scope.

        ### **Modules Used:**
        - **Pandas**  
        - **NumPy**  
        - **Scikit-learn**  
        - **Xgboost**  
        - **RandomizedSearchCV**  
        - **Streamlit**  
        - **Matplotlib**  
        - **Seaborn**  
        - **Nltk**

        ### **Project Highlights:**
        With all ethical practices considered, this is the best model achieved after multiple iterations:

    ## Responsible Use of Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Remote Workers Burnout Analysis

    ### ‚öñÔ∏è Key Ethical Considerations

    - **Bias/Fairness in Data**  
      - The dataset reflects personal experiences from different backgrounds and environments.
      - Personal identifier fields like gender, age and country have been dropped to avoid bias to certain groups.

    - **Data Privacy**  
      - The dataset is fully anonymised and publicly available.
      - No personal identifiers are used at any stage.
      - Comments are also anonymised and are summarised for theme analysis only.

    - **Transparency**  
      - The model used (XGBoost) was selected for its balance of performance and feature insight.
      - Features has been reviewed to ensure the model remains understandable.
      - This is an open source project, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/KemalYukselir/Remote-Workers-Analysis).
      - Github also contains step by step commit and documentation of the project.
                
    - **Accountability**
      - If you have any concerns or feedback about the ethical use of this project:
        - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kemal-yukselir/)
        - [Email Me](mailto:K.Yukselir123@gmail.com)
      - Ethical guidlines and documentation follows the GOV guidlines [Click here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework/data-ethics-framework-2020)

    - **Intended Use**  
      - This project is for **educational and insight generation purposes only**.
      - It is designed to explore trends to avoid burnout and support in remote work ‚Äî not to diagnose or assess individuals.
      - It should not be used for hiring, monitoring, or formal mental health evaluation.

    ### **Key Insights:**
    **Figure 1:**
    - First I wanted to check how big the burnout problem is.
    - An alarming 52.703% of Remote workers reported feeling burnout.
                
    **Figure 2:**
    - Before we dive in further, I want to highlight to employers that this problem affects them and the company as a whole. Not just the employee.
    - We can see out of those who burnout, most of them feel that it "often" and "sometimes" affects the work they do.
    - Employers addressing this issue will not only help the employee but also the company as a whole.
                    
    **Figure 3:**
    - Then I wanted to check if the type of company was the main reason for the burnout.
    - From the graphs, we can see that tech and non tech companies have nearly equal distribution of burnout. So we can rule out that the type of company is not the main reason for the burnout.
    - So it must be a company structural issue in the workplace.
                
    **Figure 4:**
    - Figure 4 shows the 10 most common words of burntout remote workers used in the comments section.
    - We can see that the word company is the most common word used.
    - This further reinforces the idea that burntout must be a more of a company structural issue
                
    **Figure 5:**
    - Figure 5 shows that on average, the less employees a comapny has, the more liekly they are to burnout.
    - Could this indicate that smaller companies have more pressure on their remote employees?
    - Or could it be that larger companies have more resources to help their remote employees?

    **Figure 6:**
    - Figure 6 shows that most remote employees who are burnt out, their company does not offer mental health as part of their employee wellness program.
    - This shows that companies should invest more in their employee wellness programs to avoid burnout.
    - This could be weekly gym membership incentives, or even just a simple coffee break with the team.
    
    **Figure 7:**
    - Figure 7 shows that most remote employees who are burnt out, their company does not provuide resources to seek and get help when avoiding burnout.
    - Just a simple check in with the emplyees can help guide them to the right resources.
                   
    ## **Conclusion:**
    There is significant burnout when it comes to remote working. Both employees, employers and the company as a whole need to be aware of this since it affects all parties.
    It has been concluded that the type of company is not the main reason for the burnout. It must be a structural issue in the workplace.
    Some key insights show that companies need to invest more in their complyee wellness programs and provide resources to seek help for remote workers.
    This could be weekly check ins, gym membership incentives, or even just a simple coffee break with the team.
                
    While remote working could benefit the employee and reduce the costs of the company, if it's not approached right, 
    it can go wrong for the employee and the company as a whole.
